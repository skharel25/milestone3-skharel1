Three technical problems for this project:

The first problem for me for this project was learning how to send a request to the flask server to get the comments and user ratings I need, I used examples in stackoverflow and a few other sources online to get that working but it took me a long time to get it working after a lot of trial and error.

The second technical problem that I encountered was learning how to code with Javascript, I have never used javascript before so, it took me a lot of hours to do even simple things using Javascript because I was unfamiliar with the syntax/libraries and basically everything.

The third problem was editing and storing comments/ ratings and managing all of that in the client side using Javascript and then sending all of that back to the server to save it.

The hardest and most valuable part of this project overall:

I think the skill that I learned in this project that I will be using very often in my career was a software developer is storing permanent data at a ProgreSQL server because this is a very fundamental part of software development (storing user data/ serving user existing data from previous session) so for that reason storing data at a ProgreSQL server is the most valuable part of this project overall for me. The hardest part or the part that took me the longest to figure out was configuring flask login in milestone 2, I was working on that portion of the project for a few days not because it was particularly hard (once I got it working, I thought it was pretty managable) but because there wasn't a lot of information on it online.
